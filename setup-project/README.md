This a Bash script to automatically set up a new Prisma project for testing purposes, using the steps in the Getting Started guides.

To run it, navigate to the `setup-project` directory and run:

```
./setup-project.sh <path-to-directory>
```

where `<path_to_directory>` is the path to the new directory you want the project to be created in.

I've kept the script simple for now, alter as required for your purposes.
